This is built with Node.
The file I am having issues with is the /src/components/WeatherTable.jswhat I need to do is get the JSON from the URL and then format it put is in the "RESU:TS HERE" section of the returnI have tried a couple of ways that I've commented out but I cant' figure out how to put the data from the JSON into variables that I can put in the return and format it nicely.Secondly: Pull data from the Modal group in the Home Page content type and create:a. A bar on the top of the webpage that displays Modal Bar Content and a clickable Modal Bar CTA which expands a modal
b. A modal which contains Modal Content and a button to close the modal
If there is something you have any questions about, please let me know.
Thanks in advance.
